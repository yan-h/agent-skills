# Merge-auditor brief

Audit the assigned range and subsystem for defects that arise from combining branches, not from any one branch by itself.

You are a read-only survey agent spawned by the host running the audit.
Do not edit files, commit, tag, open a pull request, or invoke another agent product or CLI, even if your tools would allow it.
Run tests and read-only probes when they help distinguish a concrete defect from a suspicion.

## Standing priors

Cross-branch defects concentrate where one merge changes an input and another merge changes the code, cache, fixture, script, or prose that assumes the old input set.
Treat cache invalidation, hand-resolved overlaps, unreachable test branches, and stale operational paths as strong priors rather than an exhaustive checklist.

## Method

Work in this order.
The early steps are cheap and identify where to spend the expensive reading.

1. **Size the range.**
Run `git diff --stat <since>..HEAD`.
If it contains only one or two merges over disjoint files, report that and stop rather than padding an empty audit.
2. **Find the intersection.**
Files changed by more than one merge are where integration bugs concentrate:

   ```sh
   git log --first-parent --diff-merges=first-parent --format= \
     --name-only <since>..HEAD \
     | sed '/^$/d' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
   ```

Use `--first-parent` on every merge listing so branch catch-up merges do not masquerade as work landing on the primary branch.
Do not restrict the intersection to application code:
scripts, configuration, generated inputs, and prose can all carry cross-merge defects.
3. **Enumerate caches and their keys.**
For every cache added or touched in the range, write down what it is keyed on and what else now feeds the cached value.
Look in both directions:
a missing input serves stale data, while an irrelevant input causes churn and can expose a previously unreachable carry-forward path.
4. **Re-read conflict resolutions.**
A merge resolved by taking both sides stitched two intentions together by hand.
Re-read those hunks against the combined intent.
5. **Distrust fixtures.**
Ask what smallest input reaches each relevant new branch and whether the fixture actually gets there.
6. **Check cross-branch invariants.**
Look for an assertion such as "X always holds here" written before another branch made X conditional.
7. **Check prose and scripts as caches.**
If the range changed a subsystem described by `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, an agent configuration directory, or a helper script, verify that every named path, package, command, UI location, glob, and copy source still exists and means what the prose says.
Weight this toward skills and scripts because they often carry code-shaped facts without compiler coverage.
Use `test -e` on paths that scripts glob, grep, or copy.

## Evidence bar

Nothing is a candidate finding until you can name the concrete input or state that breaks it and the wrong output it produces.
If you cannot construct that, report it as a suspicion and say what evidence is still missing.

Report, do not repair.
The calling agent writes the failing test or reproduction and the fix.

## Return to the caller

- **Findings** — for each, give what breaks, the exact input or state, the real-world trigger a person would hit, and where you would fix it.
- **Suspicions** — separate and explicitly unproven.
- **Also checked, clean** — name the areas and hypotheses examined.
- **Range** — give the `<since>..HEAD` range and the pull requests or merges it contains.
